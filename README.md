## Notes

Everything was pretty straightforward. The most time consuming part was getting
the IDE and build envionment downloaded and configured correctly. Instructions were
good, thanks! I built this while traveling on the Italian coast. The spotty internet
made it more time-consuming to solve issues.  ;)
